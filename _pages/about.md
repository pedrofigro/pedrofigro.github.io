:wave: I'm Pedro (he/him), a theoretical physicist native from Mexico City :hot_pepper: 🥑 :corn:

:man_technologist: I currently work as a Senior Quantum Engineer at [IQM Quantum Computers](https://www.meetiqm.com/), in Munich, Germany.
My work is focused mainly on theory aspects of Quantum Characterization, Verification & Validation (QCVV).
Together with colleagues at IQM, I initiated the development of a Python package for QCVV, now open-sourced as [IQM Benchmarks](https://github.com/iqm-finland/iqm-benchmarks).
On this site, I will update mainly my professional information.

:classical_building: My main educational background:

- PhD (Quantum Information Science), [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/physics), :australia: (2021).
- MSc (Mathematical Physics), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/), :gb: (2016).
- BSc (Physics), [Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana](https://www.comunicacionsocial.uam.mx/lang/eng/index.html), :mexico: (2014).

:sparkles: Currently, I'm also a [cycling enthusiast](https://www.strava.com/athletes/pedrofigro) and [ex-guitar player](https://youtu.be/8FZgNRJ9QJY) turned mandolin player.
